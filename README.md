# Oscar Perez Assignment 3 Advanced Graphics Programming
This project has been done by Oscar Pérez Martín.

You can view the source code at: https://github.com/oscarpm5/AdvancedGraphicsProgrammingBaseEngine
A release with the compiled demo with only the executable and the models for an easy plug-and-play demonstration can be found in the release section of the github repository or through this link: TODO


## Controls
### Movement
Camera movement is performed in the directions of the camera local coordinates.
* **W** (Press/Hold): Move forward
* **S** (Press/Hold): Move backward
* **A** (Press/Hold): Move to the left
* **D** (Press/Hold): Move to the right
* **E** (Press/Hold): Move up
* **Q** (Press/Hold): Move down


### Orbit


In an ImGui window when executing the app you will see the controls for the camera but I put them here if you need them:

CONTROLS
WASD, QE 	-> Camera orbit around the models
SPACE (HOLD)-> Multiplies the orbit speed

Changing the display of the different render targets can be done through the ImGui UI.
